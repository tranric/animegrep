example run:

animegrep.sh -d ../animegrep -t 2 -w "dale"

-d for directory
-f for single file
-t for track (subs normally on track 2) use mediainfo 
to double check what track
-w is for word to search
-m is merge still WIP

let it do its thing stuff will be in the out folder
clips and timetables of when

merging is now working on the -old file but new one is broken

use mediainfo to check streams/tracks
